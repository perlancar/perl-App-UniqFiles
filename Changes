Revision history for App-UniqFiles

0.08     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.07     2014-07-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Switch CLI scripts from using Perinci::CmdLine to
           Perinci::CmdLine::Any to reduce size of dependencies.
